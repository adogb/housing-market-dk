# Housing market in Denmark - dashboard

## What?
The project's goal is the creation of an interactive dashboard visualising the current housing market in Denmark. The scope is to create a dashboard updated daily, giving information on listings price evolution.

## Why?
The aim is to provide users with an overview of the market in a tailored way that common listings websites don't provide. An example of this is that average prices or other information are usually presented at commununal level. Copenhagen commune, as an example, is big and prices vary a lot depending on neighbourhoods (postal codes). Getting an average price per square meter for Copenhagen commune is not useful for a prospective buyer - you could expect to pay 20.000 DKK (~$3200) more or less per square meter for neighbourhoods barely 5 km from one another.

## How?
Things evolve as the project progresses but generally there are two main parts:
- web scraping of housing listings on boliga.dk, using Python and the BeautifulSoup library
- data visualisation and dashboard: the dashboard is available to see on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/audrey.dogbeh/viz/HousingmarketinDenmark/HousingmarketinDenmarkapartments)
